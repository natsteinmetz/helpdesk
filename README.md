== Helpdesk

Short micro-app to showcase sending and receiving emails.

The app represents a helpdesk where tickets can be created. When a ticket is created an email is sent to the helpdesk email address. The receiver can then answer to that email, and this answer will show up on the ticket page within the app.

Currently only the first part of this process is working, that is the sending of email to the helpdesk email address.
